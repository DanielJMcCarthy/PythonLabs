â€¢ Write a program that determine the tax rate based on two factors: 
salary and having kids or not:
    
If salary is in range of [30, 50] and the employee 
does not have kid tax is 40, if the salary is still in 
range of [30, 50] but the employee has kid tax is 
35. If salary in range of [50, 70] and the employee 
does not have kid tax is 50 if the salary is still in 
range of [50, 70] but the employee has kid then
tax is 45. If salary is less then 30 tax is 0 no matter 
if the employee has kid or not and if the salary is 
more then 70 the tax is 55 no matter if the 
employee has kid or not.
